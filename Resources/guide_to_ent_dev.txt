Early-stage development:

    Set up a version control system: Use a version control system like Git to track changes to your code and collaborate with others.
    Error handling and logging: Implement basic error handling and logging to catch and debug issues early in the development process.
    Modularization and packaging: Organize your code into reusable modules and packages to make it easier to manage and maintain.
    Documentation: Start documenting your code with comments and inline docstrings to ensure maintainability and ease of collaboration.
    Configuration management: Set up a basic configuration management system using a configuration file or environment variables.

Mid-stage development:

    Unit testing and code coverage: Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of your code and measure code coverage.
    Code quality checks: Use code quality tools to enforce coding standards and identify potential issues.
    Performance optimizations: Begin profiling and optimizing your code as needed, especially in critical parts of the application.
    Security: Assess your application for security vulnerabilities and ensure secure data handling and communication.

Late-stage development:

    Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD): Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing, code quality checks, and deployment.
    Scalability: Test the application's performance under different loads and identify areas for improvement. Make necessary optimizations to ensure the application can handle increased workloads.
    Comprehensive documentation: Complete the application's documentation, including a README file and HTML documentation generated from docstrings.
    Finalize error handling, logging, and configuration management: Ensure that the application handles errors gracefully, logs events as needed, and has a robust configuration management system in place.
